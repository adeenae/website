## What is HerStack?

HerStack is three things working together:

- **Curated Resources** — The best free AI/ML courses, lectures, and certifications, handpicked into clear learning paths. Not random links. The actual good stuff.
- **AI Concepts Visualized** — Machine learning, neural networks, LLMs — explained through illustrated storyboards that anyone can understand.
- **Women Mentors** — Real women working in AI across India's top companies and startups, with their LinkedIn profiles so girls can see what the path looks like.

[//]: # (And coming in 2026: **HerStack Summer of AI** — an open source program where girls contribute to real AI projects, get paired with women mentors, and earn a certificate.)
